     * The constructor receives the Game instance and stores it in a final
     * member that's accessible to all subclasses. Via this mechanism, we can
     * achieve two things:
     *
     * We can get access to the low-level modules of the
     * Game to play back audio, draw to the screen, get user input, and read and
     * write files.
     *
     * We can set a new current Screen by invoking Game.setScreen() when
     * appropriate (for example, when a button is pressed that triggers a
     * transition to a new screen).
     *
     * The first point is pretty much obvious: our
     * Screen implementation needs access to these modules so that it can
     * actually do something meaningful, like rendering huge numbers of unicorns
     * with rabies.
     *
     * The second point allows us to implement our screen
     * transitions easily within the Screen instances themselves. Each Screen
     * can decide when to transition to which other Screen based on its state
     * (for example, when a menu button is pressed).
